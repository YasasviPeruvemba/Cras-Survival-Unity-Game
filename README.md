# Crash-Survival-Unity-Game
Simple User Controlled Crash-Survival Unity Game.

If you loved games like Temple Run or Subway Surfers, this is specifically derived from a inspiration of that.

You have neither a hairy monkey nor an angry policeman after your life.

You are being guided forward by a mysterious force even Einstein can't explain. 

Black boxes come towards you in an attempt to absolutely demolish your life.

You can move left, right or jump, inside the arena that you were thrown into for the entertainment of your archnemesis Mr.Obstacle.

Did I forget to mention you were a small blue box by the way?

Clear each level to finally confront Mr.Obstacle in --you guessed it-- an Obstacle Race.

Win and you shall finally save the galaxy from Mr.Obstacle's tyranny.
